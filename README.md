# Give
An Adobe After Effects plugin for importing and exporting AetSet files (`aet_*.bin` / `aet_*.aec`) used by the Project DIVA series of games as well as various other SEGA titles such as Virtua Fighter 5, After Burner Climax and more (often with slight changes in format making them incompatible).

Aet files comprise of simple 2D layered sprite animations that are sometimes also used for defining in-game HUD / menu UI layouts and touch-screen regions.
As evidence shows, After Effects is the program originally used by the developers themselves to create these assets which this plugin tries to replicate in functionality.
